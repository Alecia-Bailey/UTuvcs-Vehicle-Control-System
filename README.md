# UTuvcs-Vehicle-Control-System

This project was designed to model the UTech TOC Ultra vehicle control system (UTuvcs) using a finite state automaton implemented into code. 

# Libraries used

The code was developed using Python and the libraries: 
- tkinter
- automata-lib 
- playsound 

# Execution

1. The user interacts with the gui 
2. The user enters a string and launches the "Generate DFA" button
3. The states visited by the automaton are  displayed as well as if the string entered was "Accepted" or "Rejected".
